Approach to the solution.

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that encodes the genetic
instructions used in the development and functioning of all known
living organisms and many viruses. DNA is a nucleic acid; alongside
proteins and carbohydrates, nucleic acids compose the three major
macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA
molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other
to form a double helix. The two DNA strands are known as
polynucleotides since they are composed of simpler units called
nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of a nitrogen-containing
nucleobaseâ€”either guanine (G), adenine (A), thymine (T), or cytosine
(C)


Here, we will be using 3 different approaches to visualize the DNA
molecule.

Mode 1:

The double helix structure is visualized using solid spheres which
will represent the nucleotides with different colors for representing
the four different types which compose the DNA molecule.The link
between two nucleotides on the same strand are represented using a
straight line to represent the polynucleotide strand. Every nucleotide
will have a compliment nucleotide in the second strand and and they
will be connected by a hydrogen bond to get the ladder structure.
We will be representing the hydrogen bonds using cylinders build from
opengl quadric structures. The double helix structure is achieved by
employing a series of transformations before drawing the primitives.

Steps involved:

1. draw the initials sphere
2. rotate the model matrix by 90 degrees about y axis 
3 draw a cylinder of height h to obtain the hydrogen bond
4. translate the model matrix by a distance h/2 .
5. Draw the link to the next sphere in the next level by drawing a
   line between (h,0,0) and (h*cos(T),h*sin(T),nh) where T is the
   projected angle and nh the vertical distance between two
   consecutive nucleotides.
6.Translate the model matrix by h/2 and draw the second sphere.
7. translate the matrix back to initial positon.
8. translate the matrix in z direction by nh.
9. repeat the steps for all the nucleotides

Mode2:
base visualization

In this mode we will represent the bases using horizontal and vertical
cylinders and make a flat structure which will be easier to study



Mode3:
Molecular visualization

Here we will approximate the nucleotides electron clouds using
spheres and arrange them in their place  to get an idea about the
electron cloud of the molecule.


We will be making use of geometric translations and rotations to
implement the pan and zoom functionality in  our model.
Zooming is implimented by translating the molecule in the z direction
about the origin. Pan functionality by translating about x and y
directions. And the molecule can be rotated by direct rotations to the
model matrix itself
